This library is supposed to become a collection of all converters used by TueNDRA. At the moment there are only two converters have been integrated:
1) the original one TCF to TueNDRA (For unknown reason it happened to be an assignment for a student. However, this code works and has been used for many years);
2) Perseus to TueNDRA (The converter for the Latin and Ancient Greek treebanks taken from the Perseus project https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data)
